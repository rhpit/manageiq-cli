Welcome! Thank you for taking the time to contribute to the project. Your

Please follow these guidelines when making contributions.

Reporting Bugs
--------------

Did you find a bug? We are sorry to hear about this and would like to know
more on the exact problem. We ask that you follow the following steps when
opening new bug issues:


* First ensure the bug you are reporting does not already have an open
  `issue <https://github.com/rhpit/manageiq-cli/issues>`_.

  * If you found an issue that relates to the bug you found, you do not need
    to open a new issue. Please feel free to comment to the existing bug based
    on your findings. The more comments the better! This will help our
    developers triage the problem and understand the exact fix needed.

* If you are unable to find an open issue related to your bug. Please go ahead
  and open a new issue. We ask that you follow the following when opening bug
  issues:

  * Create a well defined **title** addressing the problem.
  * Create a well defined **description** which explains the problem. The
    more information you provide the better it is for us to understand and
    replicate your bug. Please address the steps it takes to recreate the bug.
    In addition to the steps, if you know a potential code patch to resolve the
    bug. Feel free to add a code snippet as a suggestion to our developers.

Enhancement Requests
--------------------

Do you require a certain feature not available? Does existing functionality
lack in a certain area? We would love to hear about your request. We ask that
you follow the following steps when opening enhancement request issues:

* First ensure the enhancement request does not already have an open
  `issue <https://github.com/rhpit/manageiq-cli/issues>`_.

  * If you found an issue that relates to the enhancement request you need,
    you do not need to open a new issue. Please feel free to comment on the
    issue if you desire.

* If you are unable to find an open issue regarding your enhancement request.
  Please go ahead and open a new issue. We ask that you follow the following
  when opening enhancement request issues:

  * Create a well defined **title** explaining your enhancement.
  * Create a well defined **description** which explains your requested
    enhancement. Please provide good reasoning to why this enhancement
    would benefit the project.

Submitting Pull Requests
------------------------

We welcome all pull requests. If you plan to submit a pull request for an
enhancement or feature addition. We ask that you first create a new
enhancement request `issue <https://github.com/rhpit/manageiq-cli/issues>`_.
and self assign it to yourself. This way we are aware of the new functionality
you are looking to contribute and it can be associated with the pull request.
This eliminates our developers implementing the same enhancement you may
possibly contributing to us.

Please read our hacking guidelines for local development. These will help
ensure your code changes meet the project standards before submitting a pull
request.

We ask that you follow the following steps when submitting pull requests:

* Your forked branch name is relative to the content of the pull request.
* You have squashed all commits into one commit before opening the request.
* Your code meets the standard code lints.
* Unit tests pass and new unit tests are added to cover new enhancements.
* You updated documentation if your request changes behavior of the CLI
  that users need to know about.

Once you have submitted your pull request, our team will begin to review and
provide feedback if necessary. The turn around time for feedback on a pull
request would be between 1-2 days.

We look forward to your contributions!
