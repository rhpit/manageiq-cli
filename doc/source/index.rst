Welcome to ManageIQ Client
==========================

:program:`ManageIQ client` is a command line client for interacting with
ManageIQ platform. The client is simple and easy to use eliminating the need
to use the platform's built in REST API. The client commands are a mirror of
the REST API's available collections. In theory what you can do from the REST
API can be achieved from the client.
